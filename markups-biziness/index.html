							<h2 class="mu-heading-title">TAX AND LIBERTIES</h2>

<P> As they say, nothing is certain but death and taxes. Since we’d like to focus on the more cheerful of those two options, let’s talk
										about taxes.</P>

										<p> Taxes come in many avatars – income tax, sales tax, corporate tax, service tax and so on. There are so many types of taxes
											that an average Indian pays that often you pay a tax without even knowing that you’re paying it!</p>

											<p> Wouldn’t you like to know exactly what taxes we end up paying in our day to day lives, both knowingly and unknowingly? So
												here goes!</p> <br>

												<h2 class="mu-heading-title">DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAXES</h2>

												<P> The most fundamental classification of taxes is based on who collects the taxes from the tax payer.</P> 
												<p><span>DIRECT TAXES</span> as the name suggests, are taxes that are directly paid to the government by the taxpayer. It is a tax applied on
													individuals and organizations directly by the government e.g. income tax, corporation tax, wealth tax etc.</p> 
													<p><span>INDIRECT TAXES</span>are applied on the manufacture or sale of goods and services. These are initially paid to the government by an
														intermediary, who then adds the amount of the tax paid to the value of the goods / services and passes on the total amount to
														the end user.</p> 
														<p>Examples of these are sales tax, service tax, excise duty etc.</p>SS

								<h6 style="text-align: left;">Steps to Invest in the Indian Stock Market :</h6>
							</div>

							<div>
								<ol>
									<li><b>IPO:</b></li>
									<p>The companies file a draft offer document with the SEBI. This document comprises information about the company—shares being diluted, price band, and other details. On approval, the company offers its shares to investors through an IPO on the primary market.</p>
									<li><b>Distribution:</b></li>
									<p>The Company issues and allots shares to some or all investors who bid during the IPO. The shares are then listed on the stock market (secondary market) to enable trading. This platform is a medium offered for the initial investors to exit their share market investments. In addition, investors who failed to receive allotment during the IPO are given the opportunity to buy shares on the secondary market.</p>
									<li><b>Stock Brokers:</b></li>
									<p>Broking agencies (registered with SEBI and the stock exchange) are intermediaries between the investors and the Indian stock market. On receiving instructions from the clients, the brokers place their orders on the market. On matching a buyer and seller, the trade is successfully executed. A confirmation is received from the stock exchange and sent to both the buyer and seller.
									Historically, this procedure was manual and thus time-consuming and cumbersome. However, with online trading platforms, the entire procedure of matching buyers and sellers is done through the internet. This has reduced the transaction time to a few minutes.
									Nonetheless, there are thousands of potential investors and converging all of them in one location is impossible. Stock exchanges and broking agencies play a crucial role in this situation.
									</p>
								</ol>

								<div>
									<h6>Types of Markets</h6>
									<p>The Indian stock market includes primary and secondary markets. Companies offer an initial public offering (IPO) on the primary market, which is then listed on the stock exchange. Investors can then buy and sell these shares through the secondary market.</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h6>Financial Products Traded on the Stock Marke</h6>
									
									<p style="font-size: 15px;">Shares:</p>
									<p>Investors can invest in company shares, gain ownership and enjoy some portion of the profits. These shares form an important component of the stock market basics and are the largest product traded on the stock exchanges.</p>
									
									<h6>Mutual Funds:</h6>
									<p>These financial products allow investors to indirectly invest in bonds and shares. Fund houses pool investments from several investors and invest these in different instruments. These decisions are made by trained and experienced professionals.</p>
									
									<h6>Derivatives:</h6>
									<p>Prices on the stock exchanges constantly fluctuate, making it difficult to arrive at a fixed price. This is where derivatives are beneficial and allow investors to trade on a future date at prices fixed today.</p>
									
									<h6>Bonds:</h6>
									<p>Companies require money to take up large projects. They raise this through the issue of bonds, and bondholders are repaid through profits made on the project. Bonds are a kind of financial instrument where several investors lend money to companies.
									Investing is complex and investors should rely on professional analysis to avoid being surprised. Sticking to the stock market basics, doing the research and due diligence, and regularly monitoring the portfolio will help investors make profits through their share market investments.
									</p>
									
									<p style="font-size: 22px">SELL/BUY/HOLD - MAKING DECISION</p>
									<p>Trading decisions in the equity markets need to be backed by proper research. However, most retail investors do share trading based on rumours, speculations, tips or random picks.</p>

									<h4>Some common mistakes made by investors:</h4>
									
									<h6>Lack of Patience:</h6>
									<p>With a view to gain short-term returns people lose patience and sell the stock before they have earned a substantial returns.</p>

									<h6>Emotions:</h6>
									<p>Being emotionally attached to wrong stocks, investors do not switch to better stocks.</p>

									<h4>Lack of knowledge:</h4>
									<p>Lack of necessary knowledge required to choose the right stocks to invest.</p>

									<h4>Risk Management:</h4>
									<p>Investors are unable to have the correct risk return strategy which can lead to substantial losses for the investors.
									To avoid such pitfalls, investors need to research the markets before trading. This is easier said than done and if one is a novice investor, it will probably be very difficult for the investor to do it alone. The guidance of an experienced stock broker can help you make the right investments.<b>We at Care Investment, are committed to guide you in avoiding these mistakes which will ensure you invest in the right stock at the right time</b>.</p>

								<h4>What is a Stockbroker?</h4>
								<p>A stockbroker is a professional who executes buy and sell orders for stocks and other securities on behalf of clients. A stockbroker may also be known as a registered representative, investment adviser or simply, broker. Stockbrokers are usually associated with a brokerage firm and handle transactions for retail and institutional customers alike. Stockbrokers often receive commissions for their services, but individual compensation can vary greatly depending on where they are employed. Brokerage firms and broker-dealers are also sometimes referred to as stockbrokers themselves. The most commonly referenced stockbroker firms are discount brokers.</p>
