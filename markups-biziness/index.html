                            <p> As they say, nothing is certain but death and taxes. Since we’d like to focus on the more cheerful of those two options, let’s talk</P>

                            <p> Taxes come in many avatars – income tax, sales tax, corporate tax, service tax and so on. There are so many types of taxes
                                that an average Indian pays that often you pay a tax without even knowing that you’re paying it!</p>

                            <p> Wouldn’t you like to know exactly what taxes we end up paying in our day to day lives, both knowingly and unknowingly? So
                            here goes!</p> <br>

                            <h2 class="mu-heading-title">DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAXES</h2>

                            <P> The most fundamental classification of taxes is based on who collects the taxes from the tax payer.</P> 
                            <p><span>DIRECT TAXES</span> as the name suggests, are taxes that are directly paid to the government by the taxpayer. It is a tax applied on
                                individuals and organizations directly by the government e.g. income tax, corporation tax, wealth tax etc.</p> 
                            <p><span>INDIRECT TAXES</span>are applied on the manufacture or sale of goods and services. These are initially paid to the government by an
                            intermediary, who then adds the amount of the tax paid to the value of the goods / services and passes on the total amount to
                            the end user.</p> 
                            <p>Examples of these are sales tax, service tax, excise duty etc.</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>IPO:</b></li>
                                    <p>The companies file a draft offer document with the SEBI. This document comprises information about the company—shares being diluted, price band, and other details. On approval, the company offers its shares to investors through an IPO on the primary market.</p>
                                    <li><b>Distribution:</b></li>
                                    <p>The Company issues and allots shares to some or all investors who bid during the IPO. The shares are then listed on the stock market (secondary market) to enable trading. This platform is a medium offered for the initial investors to exit their share market investments. In addition, investors who failed to receive allotment during the IPO are given the opportunity to buy shares on the secondary market.</p>
                                    <li><b>Stock Brokers:</b></li>
                                    <p>Broking agencies (registered with SEBI and the stock exchange) are intermediaries between the investors and the Indian stock market. On receiving instructions from the clients, the brokers place their orders on the market. On matching a buyer and seller, the trade is successfully executed. A confirmation is received from the stock exchange and sent to both the buyer and seller.
                                    Historically, this procedure was manual and thus time-consuming and cumbersome. However, with online trading platforms, the entire procedure of matching buyers and sellers is done through the internet. This has reduced the transaction time to a few minutes.
                                    Nonetheless, there are thousands of potential investors and converging all of them in one location is impossible. Stock exchanges and broking agencies play a crucial role in this situation.

                                    <p>The Indian stock market includes primary and secondary markets. Companies offer an initial public offering (IPO) on the primary market, which is then listed on the stock exchange. Investors can then buy and sell these shares through the secondary market.</p>

                                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">Shares:</p>
                                    <p>Investors can invest in company shares, gain ownership and enjoy some portion of the profits. These shares form an important component of the stock market basics and are the largest product traded on the stock exchanges.</p>
                                    
                                    <h6>Mutual Funds:</h6>
                                    <p>These financial products allow investors to indirectly invest in bonds and shares.

                                    <h6>Derivatives:</h6>
                                    <p>Prices on the stock exchanges constantly fluctuate, making it difficult to arrive at a fixed price. This is where derivatives are beneficial and allow investors to trade on a future date at prices fixed today.</p>
                                    
                                    <h6>Bonds:</h6>
                                    <p>Companies require money to take up large projects. They raise this through the issue of bonds, and bondholders are repaid through profits made on the project. Bonds are a kind of financial instrument where several investors lend money to companies.
                                    Investing is complex and investors should rely on professional analysis to avoid being surprised. Sticking to the stock market basics, doing the research and due diligence, and regularly monitoring the portfolio will help investors make profits through their share market investments.

                                    <p>Trading decisions in the equity markets need to be backed by proper research. However, most retail investors do share trading based on rumours, speculations, tips or random picks.</p>

                            <h2 class="mu-heading-title">HOW TO TRANSFER FUNDS <span>INTO YOUR TRADING ACCOUNT</span></h2>

                            <div>
                                <p>The first step before you start trading is fund transfer into your trading account. There are different ways of doing the money transfer into your account. You can either use the payment gateway, the NEFT/RTGS facility or you can also pay by margin cheque / DD to your broker. When you buy shares there is a payin that is debited to your trading account and when you sell shares there is a payout that is credited. But before you buy shares you first need to transfer funds into your trading account. That is the starting point</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <ol>
                                    <li><h6>Transferring funds via payment gateway</h6></li>
                                    <p>A common method offered by brokers to transfer funds into the trading account is through the payment gateway. Large banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, SBI and Citibank all offer payment gateways. The advantage of a payment gateway is that you can use any debit card or internet bank account to transfer funds into your trading account. When you use a payment gateway your fund transfer happens immediately and your trading account will immediately reflect the credit and you start trading immediately. There are 2 things to keep in mind when using payment gateway. Firstly, each time you use the payment gateway your broker will debit a fee of between Rs.10 and Rs.20. If you are frequently adding funds to your account, then these costs can add up to quite a bit. Secondly, SEBI regulations do not permit you to load funds into your trading account using a credit card or a charge card. You can only use debit cards or net banking for the purpose.</p>

                                    <li><h6>How to add funds in via NEFT / RTGS / IMPS</h6></li>
                                    <p>The second and more popular method of fund transfer is through National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT). Typically, say the time take for NEFT transfer from HDFC to SBI would be 2-3 hours. But if the NEFT is done from the same bank where your broker has the account, then the credit is instantaneous. You will have to add the broker’s bank account as a beneficiary and then transfer funds using the password and the OTP as second level authentication. There are no fund transfer charges for NEFT. You can transfer funds into your equity trading account or your commodity account via NEFT. You can either do the NEFT transfer online or via NEFT cheque at your branch. Time taken is the same in both cases. Real time gross settlement (RTGS) is the same as NEFT; the only difference being that it is applicable to fund transfers above Rs.2 lakhs. What about IMPS? Remember, NEFT and RTGS can only be done during normal banking prescribed hours (9.00 am to 6.00 pm). If you do the NEFT after the close of NEFT timings then the transfer will only be effected the next banking day. The way out is IMPS. An IMPS transfer is instantaneous and can also be done outside of NEFT hours and on NEFT holidays. Say, the difference between IMPS and NEFT HDFC is the time taken and the 24X7 facility of IMPS. But IMPS does attract fund transfer charges and that adds to your trading cost.</p>
                                    
                                    <li><h6>Transfer through cheque / DD in favour of broker</h6></li>
                                    <p>You can also transfer funds into your trading account by drawing a cheque in favour of your broker. However, that is only possible in case of an offline trading account. If you are having an online trading account then you need to necessarily transfer funds only through payment gateway or via NEFT/RTGS. There are certain points you need to remember when transferring money by cheque/ DD. Normally, the broker will give you credit for cheque / DD amount only after the clearing credit is received. That will take 2-3 days. Secondly, ensure that your cheque is properly signed and your account is funded. Any cheque rejection results in penal charges which will be debited to your trading account by the broker.</p>

                                    <h6>WHAT IS POWER OF COMPOUNDING</h6>

                                    <li>What is limit order and how is it used?</li>
                                    <li>This is Ravi. He wants to know about limit order and how it is used. Ashish, his friend and a seasoned investor with xyz Broking explains:</li>
                                    <li>Suppose the shares of Lakshmi Textiles are trading at one hundred and fifty rupees per share. You want to buy shares in this company but think the market price is too high. So you set one hundred and twenty five rupees per share as the maximum price at which you are willing to buy. If the market value of the shares dips to 125 rupees, xyz  Broking, your trusted broker will purchase the shares of Lakshmi textiles for you.</li>
                                    <li>Similarly, if you hold shares of Lakshmi textiles, you can set an amount, say 175 rupees as the minimum price at which you will sell your shares. As soon as the market value of the shares increases to 175 rupees or higher, your broker will sell your shares. If the market value.</li>
                                    <li>Remains below 175 rupees he will continue to hold these shares. Limit orders therefore help you control the price at which you buy and sell stock. Ravi now understands what limit order is and how to use it.</li>

                                    <li>Let's introduce Dinesh, a newbie, to the most commonly used terms of the share market.</li>
                                    <li>Stock: Also referred to as share or equity, stock is the basic ownership unit of a company.</li>
                                    <li>Stock Market: This is the market in which shares of publicly held companies are issued and traded through exchanges.</li>
                                    <li>Volatility: Volatility is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, as measured by the standard deviation of returns. Simply
                                    put, the fluctation of a stock or the market in general is referred to as volatality.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Liquidity: Liquidity is how easily you can buy or sell a stock and convert it into cash.</li>
                                    <li>Dividend: The part of the company’s profits, which is usually distributed to company’s shareholders, periodically.</li>
                                    <li>Bull Market: A bull market is a market condition that means stock prices are expected to rise.</li>
                                    <li>Bear Market: A bear market is one in which investors expect stock prices to fall.</li>

                                    <h6>WHAT IS STOP LOSS</h6>
                                    <li>What is stop-loss and how is it used?</li>
                                    <li> Meet Vinod. He is a beginner in the stock market and wants to understand the concept of stop-loss. His friend Ashish, an active trader with XYZ Broking explains:</li>
                                    <li> Stop-loss is a method used by an investor to limit his losses. It works as an automatic order given by the investor to his broker to sell a security as soon as it reaches a certain predetermined price. For example, let's say Ashish buys 50 shares in ABC Mobiles at the rate of one thousand rupees per share. Shortly, the share price falls to 960 rupees per share. Ashish wants to limit his losses; so he inputs a stop-loss order at nine hundred and fifty rupees. If price corrects further to nine hundred and fifty rupees, his broker XYZ Broking will sell the shares to prevent further losses.</li>
                                    <li>On the other hand, if the share price jumps to one thousand four hundred rupees per share, Ashish would want to hold on to his shares and not lose his advantage; so he inputs a stop-loss order to sell the shares if the price falls to one thousand three hundred rupees. By placing the stop-loss order, Ashish protects his investments by retaining his gains and preventing potential losses</li>

                                    <br>
                                    <h6>WHAT IS SIP AND ITS ADVANTAGES</h6>
                                    <li>What is SIP and what are its advantages?</li>
                                    <li> Meet Ashish. With his salary hike, Ashis was determined to start saving. Ravi, Ashish’s colleague and an active trader with XYZ Broking suggested SIP(Systematic Investment Plan). Ravi explained:</li>
                                    <li>SIP or Systematic Investment Plan is a disciplined method of investing in mutual funds. You can build a portfolio by investing a fixed amount of money, say 1,000 rupees at regular intervals monthly quarterly or annually as convenient.</li>
                                    <li>SIP offers many benefits:</li>
                                    <li>It is wallet friendly and inculcates discipline and ideal for new investors</li>
                                    <li>It is hassle-free: once initiated, the amount is deducted automatically through ECS.</li>
                                    <li>You buy mutual fund units at various prices so you don't have to worry about timing the market or market fluctuations. This helps you get better returns. In lump sum investments, you have to save for a period and then invest the amount. With SIP, Ashish starts getting returns from day one, experiencing the power of compounding at its best. To leverage these benefits, Ashish is now ready to start investing in SIP with XYZ Broking.</li>

                                    <h6>Margin Amount</h6>
                                    <p>Margin Amount is the amount an investor deposits while opening a trading account with a broker.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <h6>Margin Funding</h6>
                                    <p>Money borrowed by an investor from a broker to purchase securities. This practice is referred to as "buying on margin". This allows investors to take a higher exposure, thus amplifying gains and losses.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <h6>Corporate Actions</h6>
                                    <p>Corporate Action is an event initiated by a company that causes a material change and affects the securities (equity and debt) issued by a company. Corporate actions are typically approved by the board of directors and authorized by shareholders. Some examples are dividends, stock splits, bonus issues, mergers and acquisitions, rights issues, etc.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <h6>Dividend</h6>
                                    <p>Dividend is the portion of the company’s equity paid directly to shareholders. The company provides the amount, frequency of dividend (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually), payable date, and record date. The exchange that the issue is listed on sets the ex-dividend/distribution (ex-d) date for entitlement. A company is under no legal obligation to pay dividends.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Declaration date: Date of announcement of dividend by the company</li>
                                        <li>Record Date: The date that a stock must be in the investor’s account to receive a dividend</li>
                                        <li>Payable Date: The date that a company pays a dividend or stock split out</li>
                                        <li>Ex-Date: The date that the buyer of a stock is not entitled to the upcoming declared dividend/distribution, because the buyer will not be a holder of record. The exchange that the company is listed on sets the ex-d date, based on the settlement cycle.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <br>
                                    <h6>Bonus Issue</h6>
                                    <p>It is basically a stock dividend where the company issues free shares of its stock to existing shareholders.
                                    For instance, if an investor holds 200 shares of a company, which declares a bonus of 2:1 (i.e. 2 bonus shares per share), he gets 400 shares for free and his total holding will increase to 600 shares.
                                    Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation and increase the equity base. When price per share of a company is high, it becomes difficult for new investors to buy shares of that particular company. Increase in the number of shares reduces the price per share. But the overall capital remains the same even if bonus shares are declared.
                                    </p>

                                    <br>
                                    <h6>Stock Splits</h6>
                                    <p>Stock Splits increase the number of shares outstanding, by reducing the face value per share of the company's stock. Stock split is done to infuse liquidity and to make shares affordable for various investors who could not buy the shares of that company before due to high prices.
                                    For example, a 2:1 stock split means that shareholders will receive 2 shares for every share they currently own. The split will double the number of shares outstanding and reduce the face value by half per share. So, a shareholder owning 2,000 shares out of 100,000 before a stock split would own 4,000 shares out of 200,000 after a stock split.

                                    <h6>Rights Issue</h6>
                                    <p>A rights issue to existing shareholders entitles them to purchase additional shares directly from the company in proportion to their existing holdings generally at a discount to the current market price and within a fixed time period.</p>

                                <h4>What is a Stockbroker?</h4>
                                <p>A stockbroker is a professional who executes buy and sell orders for stocks and other securities on behalf of clients. A stockbroker may also be known as a registered representative, investment adviser or simply, broker. Stockbrokers are usually associated with a brokerage firm and handle transactions for retail and institutional customers alike. Stockbrokers often receive commissions for their services, but individual compensation can vary greatly depending on where they are employed. Brokerage firms and broker-dealers are also sometimes referred to as stockbrokers themselves. The most commonly referenced stockbroker firms are discount brokers.</p>
